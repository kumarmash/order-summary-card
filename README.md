## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1) Learned about how to set images as background and manipulating it based on different screen-sizes.
2) learned more about @media queries and responsive design using flex boxes.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  min-height: 100vh;
  font-family: "Red Hat Display", sans-serif;
  background: url(../images/pattern-background-desktop.svg) repeat-x, radial-gradient(circle, rgb(216 223 255), rgba(216, 233, 255, 0.57));
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
  line-height: 1.5em;
  font-size: 1em;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  color: hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
}
```


### Continued development

My next target is to learn about CSS Grids and Javascript for adding functionality to these pages
